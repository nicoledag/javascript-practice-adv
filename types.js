/* What is the difference between a dynamically typed language 
such as Javascript differ from a static language such as Java?*/

/* In Java you cannot easily redine a variable.
String a = 'foo';
a = 1; // Error

/*Javascript is considered a dynamic language because the

let a = 'foo';
console.log(typeof(a));
// string

a = 1;
console.log(typeof(a));
// number
